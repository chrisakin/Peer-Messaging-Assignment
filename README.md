# Peer-to-Peer Chat Messaging Application

## Overview

This project is a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) chat application that allows two users to communicate directly without storing messages on a central server. The application assesses networking concepts, socket programming, security, and basic UI development.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Vue 3
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express

## Core Features

- **SignUp:** Users must sign up using email and mobile number.
- **Direct Messaging (DM):** Users can search others by email or mobile number and send direct messages.
- **Direct Connection:** Enables two clients to connect directly.
- **Temporary Storage:** Stores messages for offline users and delivers them when they come back online.
- **Online Status:** Displays a green badge if the user is online.

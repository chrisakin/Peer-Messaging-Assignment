### Steps to Start Messaging Frontend App Project  from GitHub

#### 1. Clone the GitHub Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone your project:

```bash
# Clone your GitHub repository
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

#### 2. Navigate to Your Project Directory

```bash
cd <your-project-directory>
```

Replace `<your-project-directory>` with the name of the directory where your project was cloned.

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Once you're inside your project directory, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

#### 4. Start the Development Server

After installing dependencies, start the development server provided by Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command compiles your Vue 3 application and serves it locally. It will provide you with a localhost URL where you can view and interact with your application in the browser.
